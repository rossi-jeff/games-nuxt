			<h3>Directions</h3>
			<div class="mb-2">
				Code breaker is based on the paper and pencil game known as <b>bulls and cows</b>. A
				commercial version was released as <b>Master Mind</b>. A player will guess what they believe
				the code to be and a number of black and white keys will be returned rating their guess. A
				black key indicates the correct color is in the correct position and a white key indicates a
				correct color in the wrong position. This version is set up as solitaire and allows selection
				of both the colors to be used and the number of columns in the code.

					Scoring will begin by calculating the initial max. Each turn taken will subtract the per
					guess amount and add the number of white and black keys returned. The faster a player
					arrives at the solution, the higher the score.
