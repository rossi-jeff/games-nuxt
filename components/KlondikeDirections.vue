			<h3>Directions</h3>
			<div class="mb-2">
				Klondike is also known as Canfield. In this game a standard deck of 52 cards is shuffled and
				dealt in to seven piles known as the tableau in increasing amounts from 1 to 7. The top card
				of each pile is turned face up. The remaining cards are placed face down in a pile called the
				stock.
			</div>
			<div class="mb-2">
				Four spots are designated to hold piles of the same suit from ace to king and are known as the
				foundation. The goal of the game is to move all 52 cards to the foundation.
			</div>
			<div class="mb-2">
				During play a card or series of cards may be moved from one tableau to another with the top
				card in the target tableau being of opposite color and one face higher. Only a king can be
				placed into an empty tableau location. At any time a card may be moved up to the foundation,
				but cannot be moved back own to the tableau.
			</div>
			<div class="mb-2">
				There are several variants as to how the cards in the stock are turned face up into a pile
				known as the waste. In this version cards are turned one at a time with a maximum of three
				times through the stock. Cards in the waste can be moved one at a time to the tableau or the
				foundation.
			</div>
			<div class="mb-2">
				Play continues until all cards are in the foundation or no more moves can be made.
